# Publish and Share Templates

Once you create a template, you have the option to publish it. Publishing a template will add it to the [template marketplace](https://railway.com/templates) for other users to deploy.

## Publishing a Template

After you create your template, simply click the publish button and fill out the form to publish your template.

You can always publish your template by going to the [Templates page in your Workspace settings](https://railway.com/workspace/templates) and choose `Publish` next to the template you'd like to publish.

Optionally, you can add a demo project to your template. This will be used to showcase your template in a working project, and can be accessed by clicking on the `Live Demo` button in the template's overview page.

## Sharing your Templates

After you create your template, you may want to share your work with the public and let others clone your project. You are provided with the Template URL where your template can be found and deployed.

### Deploy on Railway Button

To complement your template, we also provide a `Deploy on Railway` button which you can include in your README or embed it into a website.

The button is located at [https://railway.com/button.svg](https://railway.com/button.svg).

#### Markdown

To render the button in Markdown, copy the following code and replace the template code with your desired template:

```md
[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/new/template/ZweBXA?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=button&utm_campaign=generic)
```

#### HTML

To render the button in HTML, copy the following code and replace the template code with your desired template:

```html
<a
 href="https://railway.com/new/template/ZweBXA?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=button&utm_campaign=generic"
 ><img src="https://railway.com/button.svg" alt="Deploy on Railway"
/></a>
```
